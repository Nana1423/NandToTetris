# NandToTetris
This repository owns my project from the course "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris" 

This course exposes students to a signifcant body of computer science knowledge, gained through a series of hardware and software construction tasks. These tasks demonstrate how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other computer science courses are used in practice. In particular, the following topics are illustrated in this course:

Hardware: Logic gates, Boolean arithmetic, multiplexors, flip-flops, registers, RAM units, counters, HDL, chip simulation and testing. 

Architecture: ALU/CPU design and implementation, machine code, assembly language programming, addressing modes, memory-mapped input/output. 

Operating systems: Memory management, math libray, basic I/O drivers, screen management, file I/O, high-level language support. 

Programming languages: Object-based design and programming, abstract data types, scoping rules, syntax and semantics, references. 

Compilers: Lexical analysis, top-down parsing, symbol tables, virtual stack based-based machine, code generation, implementation of arrays and objects. 

Data structures and algorithms: Stacks, hash tables, lists, recursion, arithmetic algorithms, geometric algorithms, running time considerations. 

Software engineering: Modular design, the interface/implementation paradigm, API design and documentation, proactice test planning, programming at the large, quality assurance. 

All these topics are presented with a very clear purpose: building a modern computer from the ground up, as it turns out the many fundamental ideas in appplied computer science.
